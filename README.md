# motion sensor led powered by arduino!

This is arduino code for an LED controlled by a distance sensor.

When something comes within a short distance of the sensor, the LED will be turned on for a short time. Pressing the button on the board will cycle through R, G, and B, letting the user set the values for each by moving their hand closer or further from the sensor.
